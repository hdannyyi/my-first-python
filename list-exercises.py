#List exercises

##Sum the numbers

list_of_numbers = [3151, -12, 834, 3, 9205]

"""for numbers in list_of_numbers:
    total = sum(list_of_numbers)
print(total)"""

##Largest number
"""print (max(list_of_numbers))"""


##Smallest number
"""print (min(list_of_numbers))"""


##Even numbers

"""for even in list_of_numbers:
    if even % 2 == 0:
        print(even)"""


##Positive numbers
"""for positive in list_of_numbers:
    if positive > 0:
        print(positive)"""


##Positive numbers 2
list_of_numbers2 = []
"""for positive in list_of_numbers:
    if positive > 0:
        list_of_numbers2.append(positive)
print(list_of_numbers2)"""


##Multiply a list
"""factor = 2
for multiply in list_of_numbers:
    multiply = multiply * factor
    list_of_numbers2.append(multiply)
print(list_of_numbers2)"""


##Multiply vectors
list_of_numbers3 = [3, 7, 17, 94, -1]
i = 0
for lup in list_of_numbers:
    vectors = list_of_numbers[0] * list_of_numbers3 [0]
    list_of_numbers2.append(vectors)
print(list_of_numbers2)
